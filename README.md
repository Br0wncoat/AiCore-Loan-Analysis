### README.md for Data Exploration and Analysis Project

---

#### Project Overview

This project is centered around data exploration and analysis of loan payments test dataset. The project uses Python for backend operations and Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Key components include:

- `db_utils.py`: Handles database operations.
- `EDA_clean.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration and visualization.

#### db_utils.py

- **Functionality**:
  - Connects to an RDS database using credentials from a YAML file.
  - Extracts data from the database and saves it locally.
  - Provides various data transformation utilities.

- **Classes and Methods**:
  - `RDSDatabaseConnector`: Manages database connections and queries.
  - `DataTransform`: Offers methods for data type conversions and formatting.
  - `DataFrameInfo`: Provides functions to print DataFrame information and statistics.
  - `Plotter`: Contains methods for plotting data distributions, missing values, and outliers.
  - `DataFrameTransform`: Includes methods for imputing missing values, transforming, and removing outliers.

- **Usage**:
  - Import the classes and utilize their methods as per your data handling and analysis needs.
